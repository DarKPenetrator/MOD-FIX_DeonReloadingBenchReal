# [B42] Ammo Reloading Toolset (Realistic) - Fix

This is an **unofficial fix** for the Project Zomboid mod **Ammo Reloading Toolset (Realistic)** by Deon. The original mod is currently **broken in Build 42**, and since the creator has not updated it, this fix allows it to work again.

## üîß Changes & Fixes
- **Added missing items**: `Base.9mmBulletsMold`, `Base.223BulletsMold`, `Base.308BulletsMold`, etc.
- **Fixed crafting recipes** that referenced nonexistent items, preventing crashes.
- **Made no gameplay changes**, only bug fixes.

## üì• Installation
1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file or clone it using Git.
2. Extract the carpet named "AmmoReloadingToolsetReal" into:
  ```cmd

  ```
  And replace the existing one.





3. Enable the mod in the Project Zomboid launcher and have fun :) .
